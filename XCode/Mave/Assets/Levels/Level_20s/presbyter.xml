	<response text="Tell me who this Grums is.">
 		<npcSpeech displayName="Presbyter" text="I suppose there's no reason not to. He was a research assistant of mine. He's a structural biologist. He worked on the initial ImpHuman transformation research with me in the 90's. He's been out of the field for at least ten years now, or at least that's what I thought. You see he soon after GemTech was formed but it seems he has follwed our research very closely. He approached me a few weeks ago exposing a vulnerability in the Protocol that could derail it. He said he was going to report it to the President. I had my reasons that that should never happen so I had to stop him. I strapped him to a thing and tried to wipe his mind... It must have only partially worked because he ripped himself out after a minute. And now he is out to get me.">
		 	<response text="Why didn't you report it?">
	 			<npcSpeech displayName="Presbyter" text="For Heavens Sake! Do you think you'll understand anything by asking all these questions! I've been working on ImpHuman transformations for thirty years! I invented it! Don't you think I may have a reason? Don't you think there's a weight put on me by being the father of this process which changes all these Imps lives? I don't want the vulnerability found out because I invented it. I sowed it into the fabric of the transformation. It's there so that the program can be destroyed if needed.Now tell me how can I avoid him!!!">
