 		<npcSpeech displayName="Darby" text="No not at all! I'm just going back to work... Oh I had also meant to tell you... I found this crest at the construction site the other day. I think it's meant to be hung on a wall. Any way... I think you'd do a better job of finding the person it belongs to so here you go. Also, if you could put in a good word to management for me I'd really appreciate that. I heard Presbyter yelling at someone a few weeks ago. It was a really heated argument. Something about a IHTP and it not being the right thing. I think GemTech may have tough times ahead and I don't want to be laid off. "  actions="giveItem:darby,player,charlesCrest" maxPlayCount="1"/>
