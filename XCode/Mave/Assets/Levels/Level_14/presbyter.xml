 		<npcSpeech displayName="Presbyter" text="Alright. The last thing you remember is waking up in my lab, correct? That is because you came to me wanting to go throught the ImpHuman transformation. Everything was functioning but then we lost power. The back up generators failed to come online. There really was nothing I could do... Your memory lost must be a side-effect of that... there may also be some other artefacts, but I wouldn't worry about them... no... don't think about it. That's all I can tell you. I am truly sorry." actions="moveNPC:presbyter,up|setCustomCondition:presbyterPosition,++">
